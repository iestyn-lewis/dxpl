## What is it?

The DX Patch Library (DXPL) is an essential companion for the Yamaha DX series of synthesizers.  It contains:

* 5,026 banks of 32 patches each:  Keys, bells, brasses, basses, pads, leads, it's all in there.  
* 10,000 memory slots to store the patches you create on your DX!  No longer are you limited to saving 32 patches.
* 1,000 memory slots to store entire banks of patches.  Save and recall the entire memory of your synthesizer at once!  Perfect for live performance or building your own custom soundsets.
* An arpeggiator with features from the Roland Jupiter-4 and Korg microKORG arpeggiators.  The Yamaha DX series comes to life when you add an arpeggiator.  Latch, keysplit, external and internal trigger. 
* A MIDI velocity normalizer.  The DX keyboards output velocities from 0-100, which limits their usefulness as MIDI controllers.  The DXPL rescales the output velocity to 0-127 so you can use the DX as a MIDI controller and get full dynamic range from your outboard gear.

## How do I connect it?

Connect the DXPL to your Yamaha DX7 synthesizer with 2 MIDI cables and power the DXPL via USB cable (included) or a 9V power adapter (center positive).  

You can then connect external gear to the DXPL and all MIDI messages will be passed through to the Yamaha.  This lets you use sequencers and external controllers without having to unplug and plug cables.

In addition, note on messages from the Yamaha will be translated to values between 0-127.  This means that your DX can finally be used as a master keyboard with modern MIDI velocity values!
